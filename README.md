# CoMix study

## Description of the study
[CoMix](https://www.uhasselt.be/en/aparte-sites-partner-en/epipose/the-comix-study) is a social contact survey that followed households across Europe over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic ([Verelst et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-021-02133-y)). In Switzerland, we conducted a total of 24 survey waves from 22 January 2021 to 19 May 2022 (Figure). The market research company Ipsos MORI recruited a nationally representative sample of study participants using quota sampling based on age, gender, region, and work status through a combination of social media, web advertising, and email campaigns. The survey included adults aged 18 or above and parents (at least 18 years old) who completed the surveys on behalf of their children (<18 years old). For parents, quotas were set on region only.

Participants reported their social contacts made on the day prior to survey participation. A contact was defined as anyone who met the participant in person with whom at least a few words were exchanged or physical contact was made. Furthermore, the survey asks people about their awareness, attitudes and behaviors in response to COVID-19, and their vaccination status. From December 2021 until the end of the study, we included additional questions regarding attitudes towards vaccination that were developed together with the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). The design of the survey is largely based on the POLYMOD study ([Mossong et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050074)). Further details about the study design and methodology have been published elsewhere ([Verelst et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-021-02133-y); [Wong et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.25.22277998)).
